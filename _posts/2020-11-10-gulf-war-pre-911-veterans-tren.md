This data set consists of one row per federal fiscal year (FY) from FY 2005 - FY 2019, and reports the number and percent of users each of seven VA programs for Veterans who were in service at any time between August 2, 1990, and September 10, 2001, the dates of the Pre-9/11 Gulf War era. The denominator of percent is the number of living Veterans in the FY. The number and percent of users is cumulative since FY 2005. Thus, for example FY 2006 data includes all Veterans who served in the era, were alive at some time during FY 2006 and participated in the program at any time during FY 2005 and FY 2006.
