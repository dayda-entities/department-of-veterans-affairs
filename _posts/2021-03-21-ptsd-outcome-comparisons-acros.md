The PTSD Outcome Comparisons Across Treatment Arms table includes the results of all between-group comparisons on PTSD outcomes. The omnibus test and effect size are provided, followed by pairwise comparisons for any study with more than two treatment arms. Results are provided for PTSD severity, loss of diagnosis and clinically meaningful change for studies that reported these outcomes.

Values abstracted as NA or NR (not reported) from the study are empty cells (null) in this data set.
