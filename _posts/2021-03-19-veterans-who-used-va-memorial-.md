Memorial Affairs: All Veterans who were interred in a National, State, Interior, or Military cemeteries, or Veterans who were interred in private cemeteries and requested headstones/markers from VA were included. Due to data unavailability, Veterans who only received Presidential Memorial Certificates or a flag were not included. National Cemetery Administration (NCA) provides memorial benefits including graves, markers, flags, medallions, and burial allowances.
