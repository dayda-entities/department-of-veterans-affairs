A Veteran user is defined as any Veteran who received or used at least one VA benefit or service during the fiscal year. Veteran spouses, Veteran dependents, and active military service members who used VA benefits and services were not included in the analysis. Each Veteran is only counted once in the overall total even if he/she used multiple programs.
