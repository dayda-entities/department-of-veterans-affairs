Life Insurance: All Veterans who had an active VA life insurance policy or were in receipt of a benefit from a policy that was administered or supervised by VA were included. VA insurance programs included in the analysis were National Service Life Insurance (NSLI), United States Government Life Insurance (USGLI), Veterans’ Special Life Insurance (VSLI), Veterans’ Reopened Insurance (VRI), Service-Disabled Veterans Insurance (S-DVI), Veterans’ Mortgage Life Insurance (VMLI), Traumatic Injury Protection (TSGLI), and Veterans’ Group Life Insurance (VGLI). The analysis does not include Service-members’ Group Life Insurance (SGLI) and Family Service-members’ Group Life Insurance (FSGLI). Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) provides Life Insurance.
