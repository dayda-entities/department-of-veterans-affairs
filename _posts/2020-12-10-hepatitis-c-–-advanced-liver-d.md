<p>The Office of Health Equity (OHE) created the Hepatitis C-Advanced Liver Disease (HCV-ALD) dashboard to raise awareness of potential disparities among vulnerable Veterans for this life-threatening condition.  The purpose of the HCV-ALD Dashboard is promote equitable diagnosis and treatment of underserved Veterans with hepatitis C and advanced liver disease.  The Hepatitis C-ALD Dashboard utilizes a set of criteria - age, gender, geography, service era, race/ethnicity - to characterize Veteran groups with ALD due to hepatitis C who may require targeted intervention to improve their health.  The dashboard advances the vision for quality care and improved access to care as identified in the VHA Blueprint for Excellence.</p>
