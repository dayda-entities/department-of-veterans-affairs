<p>The 2008 Hospital Report Card was mandated by the FY08 Appropriations Act, and focused on Congressionally-mandated metrics applicable to general patient populations. The 2009 VHA Facility Quality and Safety Report report, not required by Congress, shifts to Veteran-centered metrics, and includes information related to infrastructure, care provided in outpatient and hospital settings, quality of care within given patient populations, accreditation status, patient satisfaction and patient outcomes for FY2008.  The data in this report have been compiled from multiple sources throughout VHA.  This dataset represents patient satisfaction based on survey data broken out by inpatient/outpatient and stratified ethnicity.</p>
